# Selen_Imaging project

Notes:
- Raw data source for model training: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumithsingh/blood-cell-images-for-cancer-detection/data
- Models are stored in directory /app-and-api/models (they need to be underneath the /app-and-api directory in order to be packaged into the Docker image)
